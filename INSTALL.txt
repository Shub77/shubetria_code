                               INSTALLATION


1. Binary versions
===================

1.1 Microsoft Windows
---------------------

The Windows build is distributed as a zip file containing the executable 
and required libraries. Simply decompress the zip file to a location of 
your choice and double-click Phoebetria.exe to launch the application. 

To uninstall, simply delete the folder that you decompressed the zip 
file into. Phoebetria does not modify the Windows registry so there is 
no cleaning up to do there. If you want to delete settings (such as 
saved profiles) they are saved in: 

Vista/Windows 7: C:\Users\{name}\AppData\Roaming\Phoebetria
Windows XP:      C:\Documents and Settings\{name}\Phoebetria 

Replace C: with your system drive if necessary and {name} with your 
windows login name. 


1.2 OS X
--------
The OS X build is distributed as a standard OS X Disk Image or .DMG 
file. Simply open the DMG file using Finder or Disk Utility and drag the 
Phoebetria.app to your Applications folder then double-click to open. 

The settings and profiles are stored in your $HOME/.config/Phoebetria 
folder. By default this folder is hidden in Finder but you can go there 
freely via the "Terminal.app" application or in Finder use the key 
combination Command + Shift + G and paste in the path. 

To uninstall this software simply drag the application to your "Trash" 
icon or in Finder use the key combination Command + Delete.

  commands as desired.

  the key combination Control + L and paste in the path.

1.4 Debian

2. Compiling from source
========================

    Make
    ----
    a) Download the source package and decompress it
    b) cd to the source folder
    c) qmake && make
    d) The file "99-fancontroller.rules" must be copied to
       /etc/udev/rules.d/ 
       Note: If you already have a file called
       "99-fancontroller.rules" in /etc/udev/rules.d/ then edit the file
       and add the rule manually.
    e) Restart the udev system so the new rule is loaded
       (reboot if you're not sure)
    f) The rule in "99-fancontroller.rules" gives permission to read the
       Recon USB device to users belonging to the group "fancontrollers".
       Create the group if necessary and add yourself to the group.
       Without this step Phoebetria will not have access to the Recon's
       USB connection. 
       
    *Note: qmake may be renamed on your system (for example, qmake-qt4)
