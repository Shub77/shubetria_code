## Introduction

Shubetria, as Phoebetria, lets you take control of your BitFenix Recon 
fan controller on more operating systems than the official software 
from BitFenix(R). It offers all of the same features as the official 
software, with the exception of remote access, and has been tested on 
Windows (Linux and OS X are coming)

## Features

First, the primary aim of Shubetria is to provide at least the same 
functionality that the OEM software for the BitFenix Recon provides. The 
exception to this is remote control. The second aim is to provide 
features not available in the official software. Examples of this 
second aim are software controlled "auto" mode, logging, and much more.

### The new feature are:

- Qt5
- Probe number 3 now reports the temperature of the most hot core
  between all the ones in your CPU(s). This allows to build profiles
  which control the fans' RPM based on real cpu temp and not on 
  (in my opinion) useless built-in probes.
- Many small fixes

Shubetria aims to be cross-platform. At this stage, Windows is 
the targeted platform, although Linux and OS X will came.


## About

The original Phoebetria was not endorsed by BitFenix. BitFenix worked
with the authors to create a 2.0 version, it took two years and then
the company dropped the project. The authors were so upset they abandoned
a nearly-finished project. Darn BitFenix!

## Installation

TODO

## Conclusion

I hope my little work will be appreciated, but nothing would be possible
without the wonderful work of the authors of Phoebetria.
