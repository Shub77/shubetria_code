            				This software was developed by Craig Robbins and Christopher Ferris in their spare time and released to the opensource community.
            				This project was started because of the lack of support for the operating systems provided by the OEM software.  Phoebetria 
            				currently supports all of the major operating systems including Windows, Linux and OS X.  Through the awesome support from our fans
            				Phoebetria has grown to be something larger than either of us ever imagined...
            			</p>

            				To see a full list of features and some of the people who have helped us along the way please see the Acknowledgments and Changes 
            				files distributed with this software.  If you enjoy this software or you would like the latest information then please join us on 
            				our forums at www.phoebetria.com.
