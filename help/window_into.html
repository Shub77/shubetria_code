            				This software was developed by Craig Robbins and Christopher Ferris in their spare time and released to the opensource community.
                                        This project was started because of the lack of support for the operating systems provided by the OEM software.  Shubetria
            				currently supports all of the major operating systems including Windows, Linux and OS X.  Through the awesome support from our fans
                                        Shubetria has grown to be something larger than either of us ever imagined...
