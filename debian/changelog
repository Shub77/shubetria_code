phoebetria (1.4.0-1) stable; urgency=low
   * This will be the last major release for the 1.x series of Phoebetria so
     we can focus on version 2.x development.  The release focused on adding
     some of the features users requested.  The most significant change we've
     made is localization.  Phoebetria can now be translated into any language
     and German has already been added thanks to Akron from our forums. 
     The newly added Help Menu was added after the German translation so
     that, unfortunately, remains English only at the moment.
