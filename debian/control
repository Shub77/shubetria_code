Description: Software control for the BitFenix Recon fan controller
 Phoebetria lets you take control of your BitFenix Recon fan controller on more operating systems
 than the official software. It offers all of the same features as the official software, with the
 exception of remote access, and has been tested on Windows, Linux, and OS X. The current plan is
 that future releases will add functionality and control that the official software does not
 provide â€” giving you even more control over your fans.
