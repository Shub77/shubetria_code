 "I am going to unexplored regions, to "the land of mist and snow," but
I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or
   if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the 'Ancient
                          Mariner.'"
      - Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus, Mary Shelley


Introduction
============
Phoebetria lets you take control of your BitFenix Recon fan controller
on more operating systems than the official software from BitFenix(R).
It offers all of the same features as the official software, with the
exception of remote access, and has been tested on Windows, Linux, and
OS X.

The current plan is that future releases will add functionality and
control that the official software does not provide -- giving you even
more control over your fans.

Ancient sailors often regarded the albatross as a bringer of luck or
favourable winds. The genus that the albatross belong to is Phoebetria.

Features
========
First, the primary aim of Phoebetria is to provide at least the same 
functionality that the OEM software for the BitFenix Recon provides. The 
exception to this is remote control, however this is planned for a 
future release. The second aim is to provide features not available in 
the official software. Examples of this second aim are software 
controlled "auto" mode, logging, and much more. These extended features 
shall be added to Phoebetria once the software matures and provides the 
same features that the OEM software provides (the "baseline"). 

As of Version 1.1.1 all features of the BitFenix Recon are supported.
The software runs as a normal, native application, in contrast to the
OEM software which is a web application that gets its data via a
"fancontroller" service.

Phoebetria is cross-platform. At this stage, Windows, Linux and OS X are
the targeted platforms although the software may compile and be
functional on other Unix-like operating systems such as BSD.


About
=====
The authors of Phoebetria are probably just like you. We own the
BitFenix Recon and want to coax as much from the fan controller as
possible. We like hardware. We like to have fun. We like to experiment.

Phoebetria is not (currently) endorsed by BitFenix. That said, we believe
that Phoebetria is at least as good as the "official" software and that
it unlocks the BitFenix Recon to allow the hardware to be used to its
full capacity.

We thank BitFenix for supplying hardware to use for testing; Versions 1.2.0
onwards have benefited from their generosity.

Installation
============
